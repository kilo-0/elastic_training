## 🔧 Quick Start Examples

### Create an Index with Sample Data

```bash
# Create a products index
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/products" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "name": { "type": "text" },
      "price": { "type": "float" },
      "category": { "type": "keyword" },
      "created_date": { "type": "date" }
    }
  }
}'

# Add sample product
curl -X POST "localhost:9200/products/_doc" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "name": "Wireless Headphones",
  "price": 99.99,
  "category": "Electronics",
  "created_date": "2024-01-15"
}'
```

### Basic Search Query

```bash
# Search for electronics
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/products/_search" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "category": "Electronics"
    }
  }
}'
```
